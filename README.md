## Overview <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. This was achieved by using JavaScript objects and arrays while using javascript DOM and basic events to dynamically modify the page.

### Project Objectives <a name="project-objectives"></a>

- [ ] Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML
- [ ] Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- [ ] Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- [ ] Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
- [ ] Display all books saved in the collection at the top part of the page.
- [ ] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  - [ ] A new book is added to the collection.
  - [ ] The new book is displayed on the page.
- [ ] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  - [ ] The correct book is removed from the collection.
  - [ ] The correct book disappears from the page.
- [ ] Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
- [ ] Refactor the entire code from javascript function to js class methods
- [ ] Use JavaScript classes instead of objects and arrays
- [ ] replace add and remove function with class methods to add and remove books.
- [ ] Add CSS styles to the application to make it match this wireframe:
- [ ] Modify the Awesome books application to have (See)[#Screenshots]:
  - [ ] A Navigation bar.
  - [ ] Three content sections:
  - [ ] Books list.
  - [ ] Add book form.
  - [ ] Contact info.
- [ ] Create a tappy component to change page view without reloading a new file.
